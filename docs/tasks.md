# Cymbol Compiler Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the Cymbol compiler project. Tasks are organized by category and should be completed in the order listed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [x] Implement a proper compiler pipeline interface to standardize the compilation process
   - Create a `CompilerPipeline` interface with methods for each compilation phase
   - Refactor `Compiler.java` to use the pipeline interface
   - Allow for easy addition/removal/replacement of compilation phases

2. [x] Separate compilation from execution
   - Create distinct methods for compilation and interpretation
   - Allow compilation without execution for static analysis tools
   - Enable saving compiled code for later execution

3. [x] Implement nested struct support
   - Update the symbol table to handle nested struct definitions
   - Modify field access resolution to work with nested structs
   - Add tests for nested struct functionality
   - Note: Basic nested struct field access works correctly, but method calls on nested structs are not yet fully supported

## Code Quality Improvements

6. [ ] Fix unused scopeStack in LocalDefine
   - Either use the scopeStack for scope management or remove it
   - Ensure consistent scope handling across all compiler passes

7. [ ] Refactor duplicate code in struct field access handling
   - Extract common code in LocalResolver and TypeCheckVisitor
   - Create utility methods for struct field access resolution

8. [ ] Improve exception handling in the Interpreter
   - Replace ReturnValue exception with a more structured approach
   - Add proper error handling for runtime exceptions

9. [ ] Clean up commented-out code
   - Remove or implement commented code in LocalResolver
   - Document why code is commented if it's kept for reference

10. [ ] Standardize naming conventions
    - Ensure consistent method and variable naming across all classes
    - Use descriptive names for all methods and variables

11. [ ] Add input validation to all public methods
    - Check for null parameters
    - Validate parameter ranges and values
    - Add appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

## Testing Improvements

12. [x] Add integration tests for the full compiler pipeline
    - Test the entire compilation process from source to execution
    - Verify correct behavior for complex programs

13. [x] Implement tests for nested structs
    - Test struct field access with multiple levels of nesting
    - Test method calls on nested structs

14. [x] Add tests for error recovery
    - Verify the compiler can recover from syntax errors
    - Test partial compilation of files with errors

15. [x] Create benchmarks for performance testing
    - Measure compilation time for different program sizes
    - Track memory usage during compilation
    - Compare performance across compiler versions

16. [x] Improve test coverage
    - Add tests for edge cases in type checking
    - Test complex expressions and control flow
    - Ensure all error conditions are tested

## Documentation Improvements

17. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
    - Document all public classes and methods
    - Add examples for common use cases
    - Include parameter and return value descriptions

18. [ ] Write a user guide for the Cymbol language
    - Document language syntax and semantics
    - Provide examples of common programming patterns
    - Include a quick reference guide

19. [ ] Document the type system
    - Explain type compatibility rules
    - Document type inference and conversion
    - Provide examples of type checking

20. [ ] Create architecture documentation
    - Document the compiler pipeline
    - Explain the role of each compiler pass
    - Include diagrams of the compilation process

21. [ ] Add inline code documentation
    - Improve comments in complex methods
    - Document non-obvious algorithms
    - Add references to relevant design patterns or papers

## Performance Improvements

22. [ ] Optimize memory usage in the symbol table
    - Reduce memory footprint of symbol objects
    - Implement lazy loading for large symbol tables

23. [ ] Improve parsing performance
    - Optimize grammar rules for faster parsing
    - Consider using a more efficient parsing algorithm

24. [ ] Enhance interpreter performance
    - Implement bytecode compilation for faster execution
    - Add optimizations for common operations
    - Consider JIT compilation for hot code paths

25. [ ] Implement incremental compilation
    - Only recompile changed files
    - Cache intermediate compilation results
    - Track dependencies between files for smart recompilation

26. [ ] Add parallel processing support
    - Parallelize independent compilation phases
    - Use thread pools for processing multiple files
    - Ensure thread safety in shared data structures
