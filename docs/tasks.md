# Cymbol Compiler Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the Cymbol compiler project. Tasks are organized by category and should be completed in the order listed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [x] Implement a proper compiler pipeline interface to standardize the compilation process
   - Create a `CompilerPipeline` interface with methods for each compilation phase
   - Refactor `Compiler.java` to use the pipeline interface
   - Allow for easy addition/removal/replacement of compilation phases

2. [x] Separate compilation from execution
   - Create distinct methods for compilation and interpretation
   - Allow compilation without execution for static analysis tools
   - Enable saving compiled code for later execution

3. [x] Implement nested struct support
   - Update the symbol table to handle nested struct definitions
   - Modify field access resolution to work with nested structs
   - Add tests for nested struct functionality
   - Note: Basic nested struct field access works correctly, but method calls on nested structs are not yet fully supported

4. [x] Fix function call system (EP19 Major Fix - December 2024)
   - Resolved critical null pointer exceptions in function call parsing
   - Fixed function scope detection and return statement handling
   - Implemented proper function parameter counting and type checking
   - Success rate improved from 0% to 80% in FunctionAndMethodTest

5. [x] Fix interpreter output system (EP19 Major Fix - December 2024)
   - Resolved print function implementation issues
   - Fixed interpreter execution flow for integration tests
   - Success rate improved from 8% to 67% in IntegrationTest
   - Overall compiler success rate improved from 43% to 53%

6. [x] Implement struct method call grammar (EP19 Major Fix - December 2024)
   - Added new grammar rule for struct method calls (expr.ID(...))
   - Implemented proper method resolution in TypeCheckVisitor
   - Added interpreter support for struct method execution
   - Fixed parameter handling for struct method calls

## Code Quality Improvements

7. [ ] Fix unused scopeStack in LocalDefine
   - Either use the scopeStack for scope management or remove it
   - Ensure consistent scope handling across all compiler passes

8. [ ] Refactor duplicate code in struct field access handling
   - Extract common code in LocalResolver and TypeCheckVisitor
   - Create utility methods for struct field access resolution

9. [ ] Improve exception handling in the Interpreter
   - Replace ReturnValue exception with a more structured approach
   - Add proper error handling for runtime exceptions

10. [ ] Clean up commented-out code
    - Remove or implement commented code in LocalResolver
    - Document why code is commented if it's kept for reference

11. [ ] Standardize naming conventions
    - Ensure consistent method and variable naming across all classes
    - Use descriptive names for all methods and variables

12. [ ] Add input validation to all public methods
    - Check for null parameters
    - Validate parameter ranges and values
    - Add appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

## Testing Improvements

13. [x] Add integration tests for the full compiler pipeline
    - Test the entire compilation process from source to execution
    - Verify correct behavior for complex programs

14. [x] Implement tests for nested structs
    - Test struct field access with multiple levels of nesting
    - Test method calls on nested structs

15. [x] Add tests for error recovery
    - Verify the compiler can recover from syntax errors
    - Test partial compilation of files with errors

16. [x] Create benchmarks for performance testing
    - Measure compilation time for different program sizes
    - Track memory usage during compilation
    - Compare performance across compiler versions

17. [x] Improve test coverage
    - Add tests for edge cases in type checking
    - Test complex expressions and control flow
    - Ensure all error conditions are tested

## Documentation Improvements

18. [x] Update project documentation to reflect EP19 improvements (December 2024)
    - Document the major fixes in function call system
    - Update success rate statistics and test results
    - Add documentation for struct method call functionality

19. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
    - Document all public classes and methods
    - Add examples for common use cases
    - Include parameter and return value descriptions

20. [ ] Write a user guide for the Cymbol language
    - Document language syntax and semantics
    - Provide examples of common programming patterns
    - Include a quick reference guide

21. [ ] Document the type system
    - Explain type compatibility rules
    - Document type inference and conversion
    - Provide examples of type checking

22. [ ] Create architecture documentation
    - Document the compiler pipeline
    - Explain the role of each compiler pass
    - Include diagrams of the compilation process

23. [ ] Add inline code documentation
    - Improve comments in complex methods
    - Document non-obvious algorithms
    - Add references to relevant design patterns or papers

## Performance Improvements

24. [ ] Optimize memory usage in the symbol table
    - Reduce memory footprint of symbol objects
    - Implement lazy loading for large symbol tables

25. [ ] Improve parsing performance
    - Optimize grammar rules for faster parsing
    - Consider using a more efficient parsing algorithm

26. [ ] Enhance interpreter performance
    - Implement bytecode compilation for faster execution
    - Add optimizations for common operations
    - Consider JIT compilation for hot code paths

27. [ ] Implement incremental compilation
    - Only recompile changed files

    - Track dependencies between files for smart recompilation

28. [ ] Add parallel processing support
    - Parallelize independent compilation phases
    - Use thread pools for processing multiple files
    - Ensure thread safety in shared data structures
